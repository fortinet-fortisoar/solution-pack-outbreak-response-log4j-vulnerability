# Overview 
The **Log4j vulnerability**, or **CVE-2021-44228** is a security issue that affected the Apache Log4j 2 library, a popular Java-based logging framework used by countless applications and services. The vulnerability was named **_Log4Shell_** because it involves a significant flaw in the Log4j software that allows attackers to exploit it as a shell to execute arbitrary code on the target system.

This solution pack works with Threat Hunt Rules in [Outbreak Response Framework](https://github.com/fortinet-fortisoar/solution-pack-outbreak-response-framework/blob/release/1.0.0/README.md) solution pack to conduct hunts that identify and help investigate potential Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) associated with this vulnerability within operational environments of *FortiSIEM*, *FortiAnalyzer*, *QRadar*, *Splunk*, and *Azure Log Analytics*.

## Background:

1. **Log4j Usage:** Log4j helps developers to log information, debug messages, and fix errors within their software applications. Java-based applications, including web servers and enterprise systems, use this logging utility.

2. **Discovery of the Vulnerability:** The Log4j vulnerability was discovered in December 2021. It was a critical zero-day vulnerability, meaning that it was actively being exploited by attackers even before it was widely known. The vulnerability was critical because of its potential to allow remote code execution, granting attackers full control over affected systems.

3. **Exploitation and Impact:** Attackers could exploit the vulnerability by crafting malicious log messages containing specially crafted data. When Log4j processed these messages, it executed the malicious code. This execution could lead to unauthorized access, data breaches, and system compromise.

4. **Widespread Use:** The widespread use of Log4j in various software and systems, both in the private and public sectors, made this vulnerability a global concern. Many high-profile organizations and government agencies had to take immediate action to secure their systems.

5. **Response and Mitigation:** In response to the Log4j vulnerability, software vendors, developers, and security teams worked to release patches, updates, and mitigation strategies.

6. **Ongoing Concern:** Immediate actions addressed the vulnerability; however, not all systems received those prompt updates or patches. It highlights the importance of regular software updates and cybersecurity awareness in the face of evolving threats.

The Log4j vulnerability serves as a stark reminder of the critical role that software security and rapid response play in protecting digital infrastructure and sensitive data.
